        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements covered in the prework include head, body, footer, h1-6, p, div, a, ul, ol, li, br, main, and img</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>You can use an asterisk to apply a style to all elements, a tag to apply a style to all elements of that tag type, a class to apply a style to elements of that class, or id to apply a style to elements with that id.</li>
