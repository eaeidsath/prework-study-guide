        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements covered in the prework include head, body, footer, h1-6, p, div, a, ul, ol, li, br, main, and img.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>You can use an asterisk to apply a style to all elements, a tag to apply a style to all elements of that tag type, a class to apply a style to elements of that class, or id to apply a style to elements with that id.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

          <li>Git is a tool that allows developers and others to use version control.</li>
          <li>GitHub is one of many web interfaces for using Git.</li>
          <li>A repository is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>A branch is a version of the repo that allows work without affecting other branches.</li>
          <li>A fork is  a new repository that inherits from a parent “upstream” repo.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main updates our local main branch to the latest version from the repo.</li>
          <li>git add -A stages all adjusted project files on your local computer.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "" creates a commit to your repo with a message you write in the "".</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites. One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values.</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. </li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
